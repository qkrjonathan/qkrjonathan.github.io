                        <p>
                            At this point I've probably mentioned Exabeam, the
                            Security Information and Event Management software
                            (SIEM) I had the opportunity to test out and also
                            present to the IT team during my internship, more
                            than a few times in this blog. So it's become fairly
                            clear to me, and most likely you, dear reader, that
                            it's high time that I start properly
                            <em>committing</em> to making SIEMs and log analysis
                            and alert remediation etc. etc. become my thing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            How I got from there to deciding to pursue the
                            Splunk Core Certified User certification is honestly
                            pure chance. This word, "Splunk," had been planted
                            into my head from having seen it constantly in the
                            qualifications sections of job postings. So when my
                            YouTube algorithm threw a little video about Splunk
                            to see what would happen, like a grandmother in
                            Central Park tossing breadcrumbs at pigeons, I
                            happily took the bait.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Anyways, internet pipelines are a dangerous thing,
                            and now I've committed to getting this certification
                            and proving myself as a competent basic user of
                            Splunk &mdash; and I assume to some extent most
                            SIEMs.

                            the idea a few times of getting a SIEM onto that

                            The concept of practice data didn't even exist in my

                            To be clear, I wasn't following the actual

                            getgo. But it definitely sparked something.

                            on how to pass the Splunk Core Certified User exam.
                            This is how I found out such an exam existed.

                        <p>
                            Until this moment I'd had two distinct ideas in my
                            head: (a) that I wanted to get into learning Splunk
                            and having fun with it, and (b) I also wanted to
                            have some kind of formal way of <em>proving</em> the
                            experience I'd get along the way to put on my
                            resume. Learning about the SCCU was when those ideas
                            finally merged together.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Yet another source of affirmation was

                            about how she passed the exam after 10 days of
                            studying. Now this was incredibly encouraging. Both
                            of my certs so far (CCNA and Security+) took months.
                            But two <em>weeks</em>?

                            I signed up for the Intro to Splunk course and got
                            started. In the meantime, now following Tech with
                            Jono's video from earlier (albeit using my Kali VM
                            as the OS, not Windows as Jono did in the video), I
                            downloaded the free trial of Splunk Enterprise as
                            well as the Splunk Universal Forwarder. I got them
                            as <code>.deb</code> files and unpackaged them with
                            <code>sudo dpkg -i [filename]</code>.

                            As it turns out &mdash; as it always turns out
                            &mdash; my confidence from the first day always
                            faces a little setback in the next. Having slept on
                            it, and doing a bit more research, I got a bit more
                            clarity on my roadmap.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The good news is that I learned two of the eight
                            supposedly recommended courses by Splunk were paid,
                            and they were not at all necessary to get SCCU
                            certified. (See the above updated list.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The bad news is that Splunk basically does not work
                            on Kali Linux, and I spent all that extra time the
                            day before trying to get it to work for nothing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So, defeated, I returned to the video by Tech with
                            Jono (who had done it properly on Windows the first
                            time), and just redid the whole installation process
                            on Windows. To no one's surprise, it worked
                            perfectly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now, I <em>could</em> have done it on a Windows VM
                            (and I think this is what Jono did); but instead I
                            just set it up on my laptop. But when I was setting
                            up my homelab and had to remake it from scratch, the
                            truth is I didn't want to sit through the whole
                            bootup process again when I didn't need it
                            immediately (I only needed Kali and Metasploitable).
                            Space limitations that would push me to use a VM
                            aren't really an issue here (yet), as I'm on the
                            Splunk Free license and I won't be ingesting so much
                            data as to overwhelm my hard drive anyway &mdash;
                            it's only one dataset I'm working with.
                        </p>

                            can verify that the logs from my host are being
                            ingested into Splunk in two ways: first, opening
                            <strong>Data Summary</strong> in the Search and
                            Reporting homepage, then in a separate PowerShell
                            instance running <code>hostname</code> and checking
                            that the host shown under Data Summary > Hosts
                            matches that returned by <code>hostname</code>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Second, to see for ourselves the logs being ingested
                            from the host, we run the search
                            <code>host=[hostname]</code> in Splunk itself.

                            Here's a cool little visual I made showing the
                            change in my laptop's disk space (as a percent of
                            total) over the past couple days.

                            This is combining a lot of what I've learned so far:
                            the use of <code>earliest</code> and
                            <code>latest</code> to set time ranges overriding
                            the range picker, the use of <code>rename</code>,
                            and the creation of <code>table</code> which Splunk
                            then autoconverts into a line chart visualization.
                            It also took a bit of digging around the ingested
                            logs from my laptop; while by itself this isn't too
                            fascinating I thought it was something fun to look
                            at.

                            For unrelated reasons (another story for another
                            post), I became fed up with my Windows 11
                            environment and did a complete overhaul of my
                            homelab.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For one, I switched to <strong>Fedora</strong> as my
                            daily driver, which has been incredible; it's
                            minimal, it's a fresh change of pace, it's
                            customizable, and it stays out of the damn way. It
                            took a bit to get used to how Fedora works, with its
                            .rpm packages and the default-hidden bottom bar. But
                            overall it's been great.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Anyways, in that spirit I also switched my Splunk
                            setup to the Fedora-based
                            <strong>Red Hat Enterprise (RHEL)</strong>, in a
                            VirtualBox VM. In effect it only really changed the
                            installation experience, and using Splunk was
                            obviously the same. But overall switching to Linux
                            again came with a great sense of relief. And
                            thankfully, unlike with Kali, RHEL had no problem
                            running Splunk whatsoever.

                            quizzes after each course, and I'd also mess around
                            with the BOTSv3 dataset to test out some of the
                            commands. But this wasn't really intense studying, I
                            admit ... maybe one or two hours in a day?

                            it took to get the cert, it was gratifying to feel a
                            sense of purpose in this unofficial "gap-year"
                            period where I'm still looking for a job.

                            Career-wise, it would obviously help most for
                            positions where the company actually uses Splunk.
                            But this comes with a couple side effects: one,
                            because Splunk is so expensive at the enterprise
                            level, I am definitely limited in the companies I
                            can apply for. Two, Reddit will have you convinced
                            that the SCCU cert is either a waste of money
                            because you could just jump straight to Power User
                            or Architect or something higher.

                        <p>
                            And that does make sense. But I still maintain there
                            is some worth to getting this cert. The test was a
                            motivation for me to actually hunker down and learn
                            the basics of Splunk &mdash; and, to some extent,
                            the core competencies for any SIEM &mdash; and I've
                            come out on the other side feeling all the better
                            for it. The test itself and its contents were easy
                            enough that it was a much less intimidating
                            introduction to the software than I had anticipated,
                            which would not have been the case, I imagine, if
                            I'd jumped straight to Power User following some

                            I think at this point, I should decide if I want to

                            the former, for example, I could work through the

                            have a blog post dedicated to a writeup for that.
                            For the latter, I could move into malware analysis
                            and work toward setting up my homelab in that

                        <p>
                            Neste momento eu provavelmente mencionei a Exabeam,
                            o software para Security Information and Event
                            Management (SIEM,
                            <em>informação de segurança e direção de eventos</em
                            >) que tinha a oportunidade para experimentar e
                            também apresentar à equipe TI durante o meu estágio,
                            mais de umas vezes aqui neste blog. Então, virou tão
                            claro para mim, e para você mesmo, queridinho
                            leitor, que já está na hora de propriamente me
                            comprometer a fazer a minha área de competência as
                            SIEMs e a análise de <em>logs</em> e a remediação de
                            alertes e tudo assim.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Foi pura chance como eu cheguei desde esse ponto a
                            decidir a dedicar-me ao certificado Splunk Core
                            Certified User. Esta palavra, "Splunk," foi inserido
                            na minha mente após a ter vido constantemente nas
                            seções de qualificação nas descrições de vagas.
                            Então quando o meu algoritmo de YouTube me mostrou
                            um vídeozinho sobre Splunk, eu mordei a isca com
                            prazer.

                            coisas perigosas, e agora me compremetei de obter
                            este certificado e me provar como um usador básico
                            competente de Splunk &mdash; e assumo até algum
                            ponto a maioria das SIEMs.

                            Quando eu estava criando o meu

                            algumas vezes da ideia de configurar uma SIEM nesse

                            que ficou para mim era,

                            User. Este é como descobri que um exame assim
                            existia.

                        <p>
                            Até este momento eu tinha dois ideias distintos na
                            minha mente: (a) que queria começar a aprender
                            Splunk e me divertindo assim; e (b) enquanto faço
                            isso, que eu tambẽm queria ter um jeito formal de
                            <em>provar</em> no meu CV a experiência que eu
                            obteria. Descobrir o exame SCCU foi quando esses
                            ideias se reuniram.
                        </p>

                            Ainda uma fonte mais de afirmação foi

                            estudar. Agora, isto foi incrivelmente encorajador.
                            Ambos os meus certificados até agora (CCNA e
                            Security+) levou meses. Mas duas <em>semanas</em>?

                            Splunk Enterprise e também o Splunk Universal
                            Forwarder. Eu os obtive como arquivos
                            <code>.deb</code> e os extrai com
                            <code>sudo dpkg -i [nome de arquivo]</code>.

                            As it turns out &mdash; as it always turns out
                            &mdash; my confidence from the first day always
                            faces a little setback in the next. Having slept on
                            it, and doing a bit more research, I got a bit more
                            clarity on my roadmap.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The good news is that I learned two of the eight
                            supposedly recommended courses by Splunk were paid,
                            and they were not at all necessary to get SCCU
                            certified. (See the above updated list.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The bad news is that Splunk basically does not work
                            on Kali Linux, and I spent all that extra time the
                            day before trying to get it to work for nothing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So, defeated, I returned to the video by Tech with
                            Jono (who had done it properly on Windows the first
                            time), and just redid the whole installation process
                            on Windows. To no one's surprise, it worked
                            perfectly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now, I <em>could</em> have done it on a Windows VM
                            (and I think this is what Jono did); but instead I
                            just set it up on my laptop. But when I was setting
                            up my homelab and had to remake it from scratch, the
                            truth is I didn't want to sit through the whole
                            bootup process again when I didn't need it
                            immediately (I only needed Kali and Metasploitable).
                            Space limitations that would push me to use a VM
                            aren't really an issue here (yet), as I'm on the
                            Splunk Free license and I won't be ingesting so much
                            data as to overwhelm my hard drive anyway &mdash;
                            it's only one dataset I'm working with.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Once installation of both Splunk Enterprise,

                            so as to not lose access after the free trial ends,
                            and the Splunk Universal Forwarder is complete, I
                            can verify that the logs from my host are being
                            ingested into Splunk in two ways: first, opening
                            <strong>Data Summary</strong> in the Search and
                            Reporting homepage, then in a separate PowerShell
                            instance running <code>hostname</code> and checking
                            that the host shown under Data Summary > Hosts
                            matches that returned by <code>hostname</code>.
                        </p>

                            alt=""
                        />

                        <p>
                            Second, to see for ourselves the logs being ingested
                            from the host, we run the search
                            <code>host=[hostname]</code> in Splunk itself.
                        </p>

                            This is combining a lot of what I've learned so far:
                            the use of <code>earliest</code> and
                            <code>latest</code> to set time ranges overriding
                            the range picker, the use of <code>rename</code>,
                            and the creation of <code>table</code> which Splunk
                            then autoconverts into a line chart visualization.
                            It also took a bit of digging around the ingested
                            logs from my laptop; while by itself this isn't too
                            fascinating I thought it was something fun to look
                            at.

                            For unrelated reasons (another story for another
                            post), I became fed up with my Windows 11
                            environment and did a complete overhaul of my
                            homelab.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For one, I switched to <strong>Fedora</strong> as my
                            daily driver, which has been incredible; it's
                            minimal, it's a fresh change of pace, it's
                            customizable, and it stays out of the damn way. It
                            took a bit to get used to how Fedora works, with its
                            .rpm packages and the default-hidden bottom bar. But
                            overall it's been great.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Anyways, in that spirit I also switched my Splunk
                            setup to the Fedora-based
                            <strong>Red Hat Enterprise (RHEL)</strong>, in a
                            VirtualBox VM. In effect it only really changed the
                            installation experience, and using Splunk was
                            obviously the same. But overall switching to Linux
                            again came with a great sense of relief. And
                            thankfully, unlike with Kali, RHEL had no problem
                            running Splunk whatsoever.

                            Finally finished the courses, so I decided to take
                            some time to review. I'd go in and quickly redo the
                            quizzes after each course, and I'd also mess around
                            with the BOTSv3 dataset to test out some of the
                            commands. But this wasn't really intense studying, I
                            admit ... maybe one or two hours in a day?

                            nerve-wracking, because my camera would apparently
                            keep freezing while the proctor made me show her my

                            &mdash; so much so that I became certain halfway
                            through that I'd definitely overprepared.

                            it took to get the cert, it was gratifying to feel a
                            sense of purpose in this unofficial "gap-year"
                            period where I'm still looking for a job.

                            Career-wise, it would obviously help most for
                            positions where the company actually uses Splunk.
                            But this comes with a couple side effects: one,
                            because Splunk is so expensive at the enterprise
                            level, I am definitely limited in the companies I
                            can apply for. Two, Reddit will have you convinced
                            that the SCCU cert is either a waste of money
                            because you could just jump straight to Power User
                            or Architect or something higher.

                        <p>
                            And that does make sense. But I still maintain there
                            is some worth to getting this cert. The test was a
                            motivation for me to actually hunker down and learn
                            the basics of Splunk &mdash; and, to some extent,
                            the core competencies for any SIEM &mdash; and I've
                            come out on the other side feeling all the better
                            for it. The test itself and its contents were easy
                            enough that it was a much less intimidating
                            introduction to the software than I had anticipated,
                            which would not have been the case, I imagine, if
                            I'd jumped straight to Power User following some
                            Redditor's advice.

                            to formally demonstrate my interest in that job

                            I think at this point, I should decide if I want to
                            hone in further or broaden my horizons further. For
                            the former, for example, I could work through the
                            given questions included in the BOTSv3 dataset and
                            have a blog post dedicated to a writeup for that.
                            For the latter, I could move into malware analysis
                            and work toward setting up my homelab in that
                            direction.

                            definitely a way to do it. I'll figure it out in the
