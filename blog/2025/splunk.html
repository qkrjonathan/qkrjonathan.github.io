                        <p>At this point I've probably mentioned Exabeam, the Security Information and Event Management software (SIEM) I had the opportunity to test out and also present to the IT team during my internship, more than a few times in this blog. So it's become fairly clear to me, and most likely you, dear reader, that it's high time that I start properly <em>committing</em> to making SIEMs and log analysis and alert remediation etc. etc. become my thing.</p>
                        <p>How I got from there to deciding to pursue the Splunk Core Certified User certification is honestly pure chance. This word, "Splunk," had been planted into my head from having seen it constantly in the qualifications sections of job postings. So when my YouTube algorithm threw a little video about Splunk to see what would happen, like a grandmother in Central Park tossing breadcrumbs at pigeons, I happily took the bait.</p>
                        <p>Anyways, internet pipelines are a dangerous thing, and now I've committed to getting this certification and proving myself as a competent basic user of Splunk &mdash; and I assume to some extent most SIEMs.</p>

                        <p>I have to give it to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TechwithJono">Tech with Jono</a> with getting me started on this. His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2O-qxS8nqI">video on installing Splunk <em>and</em> downloading practice data</a>  for Splunk was <em>that</em> video that YouTube fed to me to see if I was interested. And indeed I was.</p>

                        <p>While I was setting up my <a href="homelab.html">homelab</a>, I'd come across the idea a few times of getting a SIEM onto that homelab and learning how it works. But the lingering question in my mind had been, <em>How do you practice log analysis and alert triaging or whatever on a SIEM when your network has literally nothing going on?</em> The concept of practice data didn't even exist in my mind for some reason until this video.</p>

                        <p>To be clear, I wasn't following the actual instructions in that video step by step from the getgo. But it definitely sparked something.</p>

                        <p>That led to <a href="https://youtu.be/BQbwQszqjRs?si=AVGidQ7H6Hak4AjL">this video by CYBERWOX</a> on how to pass the Splunk Core Certified User exam. This is how I found out such an exam existed.</p>

                        <p>Until this moment I'd had two distinct ideas in my head: (a) that I wanted to get into learning Splunk and having fun with it, and (b) I also wanted to have some kind of formal way of <em>proving</em> the experience I'd get along the way to put on my resume. Learning about the SCCU was when those ideas finally merged together.</p>

                        <p>Yet another source of affirmation was <a href="https://youtu.be/ON1jM4_MOIo?si=g-ogriSxkQXNQDWS">this video by TYTE</a> about how she passed the exam after 10 days of studying. Now this was incredibly encouraging. Both of my certs so far (CCNA and Security+) took months. But two <em>weeks</em>?</p>

                        <p>Splunk's official <a href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/pdfs/training/splunk-test-blueprint-user.pdf">test blueprint</a> for the SCCU offers a "suggested and non-exhaustive" list of eight free training courses that cover the exam material:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Intro to Splunk</li>
                            <li>Using Fields</li>
                            <li>Scheduling Reports and Alerts</li>
                            <li>Visualizations</li>
                            <li>Working with Time</li>
                            <li>Statistical Processing</li>
                            <li>Leveraging Lookups and Subsearches</li>
                            <li>Search Optimization</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>I signed up for the Intro to Splunk course and got started. In the meantime, now following Tech with Jono's video from earlier (albeit using my Kali VM as the OS, not Windows as Jono did in the video), I downloaded the free trial of Splunk Enterprise as well as the Splunk Universal Forwarder. I got them as <code>.deb</code> files and unpackaged with them with <code>sudo dpkg -i [filename]</code>.</p>

                        </ul>

                        <p>As it turns out &mdash; as it always turns out &mdash; my confidence from the first day always faces a little setback in the next. Having slept on it, and doing a bit more research, I got a bit more clarity on my roadmap.</p>
                        <p>The good news is that I learned two of the eight supposedly recommended courses by Splunk were paid, and they were not at all necessary to get SCCU certified. (See the above updated list.)</p>
                        <p>The bad news is that Splunk basically does not work on Kali Linux, and I spent all that extra time the day before trying to get it to work for nothing.</p>
                        <p>So, defeated, I returned to the video by Tech with Jono (who had done it properly on Windows the first time), and just redid the whole installation process on Windows. To no one's surprise, it worked perfectly.</p>
                        <p>Now, I <em>could</em> have done it on a Windows VM (and I think this is what Jono did); but instead I just set it up on my laptop. But when I was setting up my homelab and had to remake it from scratch, the truth is I didn't want to sit through the whole bootup process again when I didn't need it immediately (I only needed Kali and Metasploitable). Space limitations that would push me to use a VM aren't really an issue here (yet), as I'm on the Splunk Free license and I won't be ingesting so much data as to overwhelm my hard drive anyway &mdash; it's only one dataset I'm working with.</p>

                        <p>Once installation of both Splunk Enterprise, <a href="https://help.splunk.com/en/splunk-enterprise/administer/admin-manual/9.2/configure-splunk-licenses/about-splunk-free">which I promptly converted to Splunk Free</a> so as to not lose access after the free trial ends, and the Splunk Universal Forwarder is complete, I can verify that the logs from my host are being ingested into Splunk in two ways: first, opening <strong>Data Summary</strong> in the Search and Reporting homepage, then in a separate PowerShell instance running <code>hostname</code> and checking that the host shown under Data Summary > Hosts matches that returned by <code>hostname</code>.</p>

                        <img src="../../uploads/splunkverifyhostname.png" width="100%" alt="">

                        <p>Second, to see for ourselves the logs being ingested from the host, we run the search <code>host=[hostname]</code> in Splunk itself.</p>

                        <img src="../../uploads/splunkcheckhostlogs.png" width="100%" alt="">

                        <p>I also got the <a href="https://github.com/splunk/botsv3">practice dataset</a>, Boss of the SOC (BOTS) Dataset Version 3, that Tech with Jono had recommended, and once that was installed I ran the search <code>index=botsv3</code> in Splunk to verify the logs had been ingested properly.</p>
