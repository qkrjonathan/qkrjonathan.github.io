                            Which leaves you seemingly with a couple options,
                            which all sound horrible.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The first is
                            <strong>switching to Windows 11</strong>. The fact
                            that some machines running Windows 10 can't even
                            meet the hardware requirements for the new version
                            says more than enough. Thankfully(?) my laptop was
                            not one of those machines. When I eventually reneged
                            to the endless barrage of "reminders" to update to
                            Windows 11, however, my Bluetooth headphones refused
                            to connect, and my already dying trackpad (which is
                            my fault, I admit) gladly took the opportunity to
                            simply cease to function.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The other is ...
                            <strong><em>throwing your laptop away?</em></strong>
                            Or as Microsoft sugarcoats it, "to leverage trade-in
                            and recycling programs." Recycling is fine and all,
                            but it doesn't change the fact that if my computer
                            were to not meet the requirements, or I simply did
                            not like Windows 11, then my own computer, that is
                            currently in my possession, and that I bought with
                            my own money, and that clearly still works????
                            basically becomes waste.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            But there has always been a
                            <em>secret third option</em>. Well, not so secret,
                            because so many people already use it; and even more
                            people are probably using it ever since

                        <p>
                            But yes. It's <strong>switching to Linux</strong>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Linux has somewhat of a reputation, partially for
                            being a niche thing that only nerds use, and
                            partially for being the thing that annoying people
                            use. (These are not mutually exclusive.)
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Whether I myself, having run some distribution of
                            Linux as my daily driver for almost a year now, have
                            become one of those said annoying people is a
                            question I will decidedly ignore. In any case, the
                            former is definitively untrue. Android runs on
                            Linux. So does Instagram, Facebook, Twitter,
                            YouTube, the New York Stock Exchange.
                        </p>

                        <p>And so should you. Potentially. Perchance.</p>

                        <p>
                            Maybe you feel a bit intimidated by the fact that
                            you're running, to some extent, the same operating
                            system as the Pentagon. (Which is probably not
                            true.) But for you, perhaps a more casual user,
                            Linux could look as simple as this:
                        </p>

                            Exactly. This is <strong>Linux Mint</strong>. Here's

                                    Pearson VUE for any reason (such as getting
                                    certifications for your career), those tend
                                    to only work on Windows. And virtual

                        <p>O apoio oficial do Windows 10 vai acabar no dia 14 de outubre 2025. Claro que isto não significa que o seu notebook existente com Windows 10 magicamente explode ou falha nessa data exata, mas, falando simplesmente, o Microsoft simplesmente vai deixar de se importar dessa versão. Nem mais atualizações de segurança, nem mais apoio tecnical. Você será sozinho.</p>

                        <br />

                        <br />

                        <p>Depois disso, você tem agora duas opções, das quais ambos parecem horriveis.</p>

                        <p>A primeira é <strong>mudar para o Windows 11</strong>. O fato de que algumas máquinas que agora mesmo estão usando Windows 10 nem podem satisfazer os requisitos de hardware para a nova versão diz mais do que o suficiente. Felizmente(?) meu notebook não foi uma dessas máquinas. Quando finalmente cedi ao monte das "lembretes" para atualizar ao Windows 11, embora, meus fones Bluetooth refusou a conectar-se, e meu trackpad que já estava morrendo (que é a culpa minha &mdash; isso eu admito) aproveitou com prazer a oportunidade para simplesmente deixar de funcionar.</p>

                        <p>A outra é ... <strong><em>jogar fora seu notebook inteiro??</em></strong> Ou, como o Microsoft expressa mais suavemente, "aproveitar programas de troca ou reciclagem." É bom reciclar, claro, mas isso não muda o fato de que se meu computador não satisfazesse os requisitos, ous e eu simplesmente não gostasse do Windows 11, então meu próprio computador, que atualmente está na minha posse, e que comprei com meu próprio dinheiro, e que claramente ainda funciona???? básicamente fica lixo.</p>

                        <p>Mas sempre tem sido uma terçeira opçao secreta. Bem, não tão secreta, porque tanta gente já o usa; e ainda mais pessoas provavelmente estão o usando após <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVI_smLgTY0">o PewDiePie fez seu vídeo sobre ele</a>, que acumulou mais de 6.4 milhões visualizações na época deste post.</p>

                        <p>Mas sim. É <strong>mudar para o Linux</strong>.</p>

                        <p>Olha, já sei que o Linux tem uma reputaçãozinha, em parte para ser uma coisa de nicho que só os nerds usam, e em parte para ser a coisa que as pessoas irritantes usam. (Essas não são mutuamente exclusivas.)</p>

                        <p>A questão de se eu mesmo, tendo usado alguma distribuição do Linux como meu <em>daily driver</em> há quase um ano, já me tornei uma dessas pessoas irritantes, é uma que claramente vou ignorar. De qualquer forma, a primeira é definitivamente errada. O Android funciona em Linux. O mesmo com o Instagram, o Facebook, o Twitter, o YouTube, a Bolsa de Valores de Nova Iorque.</p>

                        <p>E será o mesmo com você? Eu acho que deve, sim.</p>

                        <p>Talvez você tenha um pouco de medo pelo fato de que você executaria, até um ponto, o sistema de operação igual como o Pentágono. (Isso provavelmente não é a verdade.) Mas para você, o Linux poderia parecer tão simples como isso:</p>

                        <p>Limpo, elegante, e parece um pouco como o Windows?</p>

                        <p>É isso. Este é o <strong>Linux Mint</strong>. Aquí está porque você deve adquiri-lo.</p>

                        <h4 id="should-pt">Porque você deve adquiri-lo</h4>

                        <ul>
                            <li><p><strong>Basicamente nenhuma configuração.</strong> É só seguir <a href="https://linuxmint-installation-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">as instruções num sítio do web</a>, sem qualquer código, sem nada. Mas o que voce precisa é um pendrive.</p></li>
                            <li><p><strong>É grátis.</strong> E não há nenhuma condição. Ao contrário de algumas empresas.</p></li>
                            <li><p><strong>É de código aberto</strong>, que, claro, não garante nada, mas significa que se o desenvolvidor tentasse fazer algo estranho com ele, alguem realmente poderia perceber. Ao contrário de algumas empresas.</p></li>
                            <li><p><strong>Sem notificações irritantes</strong>, por exemplo sobre a porra do Xbox Game Pass de que ninguém se importa.</p></li>
                            <li><p><strong>Pode experimentar por qualquer tempo que você quer antes de dedicar-se a ele.</strong></p> O Linux Mint pode executar-se desde um pendrive, e ficará assim até você explicitamente concorda a ele assumir o controle do seu notebook (ou <em>dual-boot</em> com o Windows, veja sob "Outras considerações").</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 id="shouldnt-pt">Porque você NÂO deve adquiri-lo</h4>

                        <ul>
                            <li><p><strong>Você é obrigado a depender de ferramentas do Microsoft,</strong> e.g. para trabalho (Outlook, Teams, Edge 👎). Isso é assumindo que você não tem um outro notebook para trabalho de que pode depender para software assim.</p></li>
                            <li><p><strong>Você joga qualquer jogo que não tem apoio <em>anti-cheat</em> para Linux</strong>, atual ou planeado. Isso inclui Valorant, Apex, Battlefield 2042, Fortnite ... <a href="https://areweanticheatyet.com/">Pode ver a lista inteira aqui</a>. Se vpcê considera-se um <em>hardcore PC gamer</em>, então Linux pode parecer bem restrito. <em><strong>Mas</strong></em>, as boas noticias são que já existe um software chamado <a href="https://www.protondb.com">Proton</a> que faz (muitos, mas nem todos) os jogos no Windows executar-se no Linux. Basicamente pode assumir que se for verificado para <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/verified">Steam Deck</a>, executa-se no Linux.</p></li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Você depende de qualquer software criativo do Adobe</strong> (tipo Photoshop, Premiere, Illustrator, etc.) já que eles não existem no Linux e nunca vâo existir ... mas considerando só quão predatório os serviços do Adobe tem sido tornando-se, talvez isso poderia sua oportunidade para escapar o ecossistema dele completamente? Por exemplo, aquí é um <a href="https://youtu.be/PEFqdqRr18E?si=2us1qZ3JcWH4bpZd">vídeo no YouTube sobre fazer vídeos inteiramente no Linux</a>.</p>

                        <h4 id="further-pt">Outras considerações</h4>

                        <ul>
                            <li><p>Se você for um pessoa que gosta de programação, você terá que refazer todos os seus ambientes de novo. (IDEs, repositórios clonados do GitHub, configuração do Git CLI)</p></li>
                            <li><p>Instala-se aplicações não pelos assistentes de instalação como se vê no Windows, mas por pacotes que você pode obter no Software Manager (que funciona igual como o app store), ou pelo command line via <code>sudo apt-get install [nome]</code>.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Não há Microsoft Office, claro, e o equivalente de código aberto, LibreOffice, é instalado por padrão. Admito que pode ser um pouco caótico e chato para usar, comparado com os apps do Microsoft, mas ainda são utilizáveis, qual é ultimamente tudo que se importa. Tem nada impedindo você de usar os apps do Google, embora <a href="../2024/google-monopoly.html">tem outras razões por nem usar eles</a>.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Se você fazer provas supervisionado online, tipo pelo Pearson VUE, por qualquer razão (tipo obter certificados para sua carreira), no usual esses só funcionam no Windows. E não dá para usar as máquinas virtuais, também. Digo isso porque eu já tinha problemas com o meu exame de <a href="splunk.html">Splunk Core Certified User</a> após já mudar para o Linux.</p></li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Se, infelizmente mas realmente, ainda absolutamente precisa do Windows na sua vida (Adobe, Microsoft Office e os exames online são umas das razões mais fortes na minha vida pessoal, pelo menos), <strong>você tem opções!!!</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>A mais fácil (e gratuita): Sempre pode fazer <strong>dual-boot</strong> do Linux Mint e do Windows na mesma máquina. (Sim, seu computador pode ter mais de um sistema de operação no mesmo disco rígido.) <a href="https://linuxmint-installation-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/multiboot.html">Há mais informações aqui se você for curioso.</a></p>
                                        <p>Mas uma nota importante: <strong><em>O WINDOWS DEVE SER INSTALADO PRIMEIRO!!!</em></strong> Ou seja, nem tente de reinstalar o Windows após já apagar o seu  disco rígido inteiro para o Linux Mint. Tenho <a href="../2024/kernel-panic.html">um blog post inteiro</a> sobre porque esse foi um verdadeiro pesadelo.</p>
