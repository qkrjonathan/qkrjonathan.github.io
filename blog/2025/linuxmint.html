                            Which leaves you seemingly with a couple options,
                            which all sound horrible.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The first is
                            <strong>switching to Windows 11</strong>. The fact
                            that some machines running Windows 10 can't even
                            meet the hardware requirements for the new version
                            says more than enough. Thankfully(?) my laptop was
                            not one of those machines. When I eventually reneged
                            to the endless barrage of "reminders" to update to
                            Windows 11, however, my Bluetooth headphones refused
                            to connect, and my already dying trackpad (which is
                            my fault, I admit) gladly took the opportunity to
                            simply cease to function.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The other is ...
                            <strong><em>throwing your laptop away?</em></strong>
                            Or as Microsoft sugarcoats it, "to leverage trade-in
                            and recycling programs." Recycling is fine and all,
                            but it doesn't change the fact that if my computer
                            were to not meet the requirements, or I simply did
                            not like Windows 11, then my own computer, that is
                            currently in my possession, and that I bought with
                            my own money, and that clearly still works????
                            basically becomes waste.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            But there has always been a
                            <em>secret third option</em>. Well, not so secret,
                            because so many people already use it; and even more
                            people are probably using it ever since

                            But yes. It's <strong>switching to Linux</strong>.

                        <p>
                            Linux has somewhat of a reputation, partially for
                            being a niche thing that only nerds use, and
                            partially for being the thing that annoying people
                            use. (These are not mutually exclusive.)
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Whether I myself, having run some distribution of
                            Linux as my daily driver for almost a year now, have
                            become one of those said annoying people is a
                            question I will decidedly ignore. In any case, the
                            former is definitively untrue. Android runs on
                            Linux. So does Instagram, Facebook, Twitter,
                            YouTube, the New York Stock Exchange.
                        </p>

                        <p>And so should you. Potentially. Perchance.</p>

                        <p>
                            Maybe you feel a bit intimidated by the fact that
                            you're running, to some extent, the same operating
                            system as the Pentagon. But for you, perhaps a more
                            casual user, Linux could look as simple as this:
                        </p>

                            Exactly. This is <strong>Linux Mint</strong>. Here's

                            You'll see. Maybe you can't. But you should, if you
                            can. So you should.)
