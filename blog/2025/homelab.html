                        This is the opening of a new world for me. I’ve been looking into home labs for a little bit, now being fresh out of college, newly minted bachelor’s degree and all. With my summer internship in cybersecurity fading further and further into the past, I hadn’t had the chance since then to “practice” cybersecurity, as it were, until this moment. Now, free of my studies, I have the opportunity at last.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I remember one thing that struck me as particularly intriguing during the internship was vulnerability management. At Aristotle, where I’d interned, pretty much every facet of their infosec protocol was feeding into the same interface — their Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, Exabeam — and while that algorithmic smushing did yield a big-picture overview of how those facets came together, I don’t think I really had the time to delve deep into a single particular area. But when I did have some time, I found myself tinkering in Tenable, trawling through that endless, computer-detected list of CVEs and entertaining myself by seeing which ones actually mattered to the company.

                    </p>
                   <p>As time passes, I can always mold my newfound home lab for other purposes, but for now, I wanted to dig into this fascinating field of vulnerability assessment and management. </p>

                   <p>Before that, though, I wanted to first get a feel for setting up an absolute barebones network: an internal network of two VMs — one Kali Linux as the attacker, and one Windows 10 as the target — with manually set IPs. </p>
