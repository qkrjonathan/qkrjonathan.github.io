                    <h6>22 November 2024</h6>
                    <p>
                        On 20 November, the U.S. Department of Justice
                        <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp81ppr3l9go"
                            >submitted a court filing</a
                        >
                        demanding that Google sell its browser Chrome and be
                        banned from pursuing contracts that make its search
                        engine the default on smartphones and laptops. This
                        comes amid an ongoing effort to break up Google's
                        domineering monopoly on the online search market, with a
                        federal judge
                        <a
                            href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-judge-rules-google-broke-antitrust-law-search-case-2024-08-05/"
                            >already having ruled</a
                        >
                        that Google "is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to
                        maintain its monopoly." (Google has said they intend to
                        appeal that decision, though it remains unclear to what
                        extent.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For a while now, as that legal fight has been under
                        progress, I've been sitting with an ick about Google's
                        overwhelming control over my daily online life &mdash;
                        not to mention its exploitation of the resulting data it
                        collects for its own profit, privacy be damned.
                        Everywhere I go, on any public or work device I use,
                        Google Chrome is always a default; I'm forced to use
                        Google's suite of services (Gmail, Drive, Docs, ...) at
                        my university; Google is the default on my iPhone's
                        browsers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sometime last month, that ick finally pushed me to act.
                        But escaping Google's grasp was even harder than I
                        initially thought.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Below I break down the steps I took to try that
                        regardless, as well as additional measures I'd recommend
                        to maximize privacy.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Step 1: Firefox</h4>

                    <p>
                        This one is a no-brainer. Even in its default state,
                        it's still a major improvement from Chrome. But it's
                        only as good as its configuration, so here's some quick
                        additional steps:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>

                                In Settings > Privacy (about:settings#privacy).
                            </p>

                        />
                        <li>
                            <p>

                                >
                                Firefox, as with other browsers, uses Global
                                Privacy Control (GPC), which sends a signal to
                                businesses that a user does not want their
                                personal information to be sold or shared.
                                (Mozilla itself was involved in GPC's
                                development.)
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong
                                    >Send websites a "Do Not Track"
                                    request.</strong
                                >
                                This sends a similar signal to every website you
                                visit and its third-party partners that you do
                                not want your browsing behavior tracked. But
                                websites don't have to comply with that request.
                            </p>

                                No browser is complete with uBlock. It's a
                                content filtering extension that's stunningly
                                effective, less memory-intensive than its
                                competitors, and customizable.

                            >(I personally use Firefox Nightly, but only because
                            it has vertical tabs on a sidebar, as opposed to
                            horizontally over the top bar. I wouldn't
                            necessarily recommend it beyond that feature; if you
                            do want to switch to that, be sure to turn off
                            allowing Nightly to send technical and interaction
                            data to Mozilla (Settings > Privacy) if that's
                            something you're uncomfortable with. It is turned on
                            by default.)

                    <h4>Step 2: Startpage</h4>
                    <p>
                        Startpage is a privacy-focused search engine that has
                        honestly served me well in 99% of my use cases. It
                        serves Google search results without* tracking your
                        activity and selling it to third parties.

                            that Startpage had apparently started to fingerprint
                            users. The entire thread is somewhat of a
                            nerve-wracking read; but after some more
                            investigating, and Startpage themselves intervening
                            to do damage control, all but a few of the users
                            seemed convinced that the fingerprinting was for the
                            limited use case of bot detection/abuse prevention.
                            For that reason, and this thread being the last
                            major concern about the service to my knowledge, I
                            keep this recommendation in this post.</em

                    <p>Another consideration, from PrivacyGuides themselves:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>
                            Startpage's majority shareholder is System1 who is
                            an adtech company. We don't believe that to be an
                            issue as they have a distinctly separate privacy
                            policy. The Privacy Guides team reached out to
                            Startpage back in 2020 to clear up any concerns with
                            System1's sizeable investment into the service, and
                            we were satisfied with the answers we received.

                        Search engines are their own rabbit holes; if you want
                        to go further, you can check out the metasearch engine
                        <a href="https://docs.searxng.org/">SearXNG</a>, and/or
                        rotate between multiple search engines so that your
                        search history can't be tracked to a single place. But
                        realistically, for most people that's a lot to ask for.

                    <h4>Step 3: Proton Mail</h4>

                    <p>
                        For most purposes, Gmail is secure enough. But security
                        and privacy are separate things &mdash; as in, one is
                        about the ability of an unauthorized actor getting to
                        your data, and the other is about an authorized actor
                        getting it and selling it for profit. Until 2017, Google
                        had been
                        <a
                            href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/06/26/534451513/google-says-it-will-no-longer-read-users-emails-to-sell-targeted-ads"
                            >scanning users' emails within the free consumer
                            ecosystem to serve targeted ads</a
                        >, before it stopped the practice to merge policies with
                        its corporate-facing service. And that change only
                        happened, after at least 13 years of selling the info,
                        because "some current or prospective paying enterprise
                        customers," not free-tier consumers, "were uncomfortable
                        with this practice," said Seth Schoen, of the digital
                        rights group Electronics Frontier Foundation, in
                        <a
                            href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/23/technology/gmail-ads.html"

                        >.

                    <p>
                        Scanning of Gmail messages nonetheless continues, at
                        Google's discretion, though presumably that information
                        is only for internal use and not for advertisements.
                        Whether one is to trust such claims from Google is, at
                        this point, a matter of opinion. I personally don't feel
                        like risking it; so I moved to Proton Mail.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unlike Gmail, Proton uses client-side encryption &mdash;
                        that is, messages are encrypted before they're sent to
                        mail servers, meaning Proton couldn't scan the contents
                        of that message even if they wanted to. Since Proton
                        itself is headquartered outside the U.S., in
                        Switzerland, your email data is regulated under the much
                        stricter GDPR framework, and falls outside of the
                        purview of U.S. (and
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes"

                        keen as Google is to hand over data to law enforcement,
                        and it only complies when absolutely necessary. (It was
                        only last month that Google decided it would

                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Considerations</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        If I were born yesterday, and I were able to use Proton
                        Mail as soon as I left the womb, perhaps that would have
                        been ideal. Clearly that is not the case. Since
                        childhood, I've had several Gmail accounts, and at this
                        point my current account is linked to so many
                        third-party services via federation that it's almost
                        impossible to track down the extent of it, or control
                        it, unless I deleted the account entirely &mdash; but
                        then I wouldn't know what I'd be losing access to,
                        including any crucial services I happened to forget
                        about.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That's not to mention my university forces me to use
                        their own Google Workspace, which is neither here nor
                        there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But all of this is (mostly) out of my control by this
                        point. What I can do is move forward with Proton. I've
                        switched most of my frequently used third-party accounts
                        &mdash; LinkedIn, my bank accounts &mdash; and other
                        work-related miscellanea to my Proton email. I have a
                        separate "throwaway" email that I use for other things
                        in my personal life, like Amazon, Twitch and various
                        newsletters that I don't want to clog up my work email.
                        I also set up that email so messages sent to my Gmail
                        are forwarded to Proton. So far, that system is working
                        out quite well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As with all things, this is just the beginning of
                        another rabbit hole, along which you may find things
                        like <a href="https://addy.io/">addy.io</a>, an email
                        forwarding service that gives you an obscured email
                        address so you don't have to unnecessarily give out your
                        actual email. However you deep you may fall into that
                        rabbit hole, Proton Mail is nonetheless a good start.

                    <h4>Step 4: LibreOffice / WPS</h4>
                    <p>
                        Hairs have been standing on end as of late as Google is
                        diving deeper and deeper into the AI/ML space, and many
                        who use Google's suite of document editors are becoming
                        suspicious as to whether their data will be used to
                        train generative models without their consent or
                        knowledge. So far Google is vehemently denying this, but
                        whether we can trust them is another matter entirely.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        LibreOffice is the much touted, community-driven
                        alternative to Google's (and Microsoft's) services. It
                        has many of the same features that those more mainstream
                        suites have, while allowing for a degree of safety
                        knowing these files are locally hosted and not scanned
                        by a corporation as Google Docs are.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For most use cases, LibreOffice works just fine. If
                        you're looking to do something that's fairly specific,
                        and that does work on either Google or Microsoft &mdash;
                        e.g. using Morph transitions between slides on
                        PowerPoint, that's something that will be a lot more
                        difficult to accomplish. Another drawback is that
                        imports of .docx, .ppt etc. files are not always
                        perfect, and it'll be annoying to fix it. If you have a
                        job or other obligation that would require you to then
                        reupload a finished file to be opened with Microsoft or
                        Google, it'll then be need to fixed again after that
                        fact. But in more isolated use cases where that doesn't
                        matter, it works just fine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In terms of quality, WPS is a much better alternative
                        that I've personally been using. Its knockoff of
                        PowerPoint even has equally effective Morph transitions,
                        which impressed it. But a huge caveat is that as a whole
                        it isn't open-source, and it's developed and maintained
                        by the Chinese software company Kingsoft. Take that how
                        you will. The Linux version, at least, is
                        community-operated as of 2019, so if you're a Linux user
                        you can still use it with a reasonable degree of
                        reassurance. Still, be wary of
