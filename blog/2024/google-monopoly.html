                    <h2>Escaping Google's monopoly</h2>
                    <h6>22 November 2024</h6>
                    <p>
                        On 20 November, the U.S. Department of Justice
                        <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp81ppr3l9go"
                            >submitted a court filing</a
                        >
                        demanding that Google sell its browser Chrome and be
                        banned from pursuing contracts that make its search
                        engine the default on smartphones and laptops. This
                        comes amid an ongoing effort to break up Google's
                        domineering monopoly on the online search market, with a
                        federal judge
                        <a
                            href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-judge-rules-google-broke-antitrust-law-search-case-2024-08-05/"
                            >already having ruled</a
                        >
                        that Google "is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to
                        maintain its monopoly." (Google has said they intend to
                        appeal that decision, though it remains unclear to what
                        extent.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For a while now, as that legal fight has been under
                        progress, I've been sitting with an ick about Google's
                        overwhelming control over my daily online life &mdash;
                        not to mention its exploitation of the resulting data it
                        collects for its own profit, privacy be damned.
                        Everywhere I go, on any public or work device I use,
                        Google Chrome is always a default; I'm forced to use
                        Google's suite of services (Gmail, Drive, Docs, ...) at
                        my university; Google is the default on my iPhone's
                        browsers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sometime last month, that ick finally pushed me to act.
                        But escaping Google's grasp was even harder than I
                        initially thought.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Below I break down the steps I took to try that
                        regardless, as well as additional measures I'd recommend
                        to maximize privacy.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Step 1: Firefox</h4>

                    <p>
                        This one is a no-brainer. Even in its default state,
                        it's still a major improvement from Chrome. But it's
                        only as good as its configuration, so here's some quick
                        additional steps:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong

                                >
                                In Settings > Privacy (about:settings#privacy).
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            width="50%"
                        />
                        <li>
                            <p>

                                    >Tell websites not to sell or share my

                                >
                                Firefox, as with other browsers, uses Global
                                Privacy Control (GPC), which sends a signal to
                                businesses that a user does not want their
                                personal information to be sold or shared.
                                (Mozilla itself was involved in GPC's
                                development.)
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong
                                    >Send websites a "Do Not Track"
                                    request.</strong
                                >
                                This sends a similar signal to every website you
                                visit and its third-party partners that you do
                                not want your browsing behavior tracked. But
                                websites don't have to comply with that request.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                                No browser is complete with uBlock. It's a
                                content filtering extension that's stunningly
                                effective, less memory-intensive than its
                                competitors, and customizable.
                            </p>

                        <em
                            >(I personally use Firefox Nightly, but only because
                            it has vertical tabs on a sidebar, as opposed to
                            horizontally over the top bar. I wouldn't
                            necessarily recommend it beyond that feature; if you
                            do want to switch to that, be sure to turn off
                            allowing Nightly to send technical and interaction
                            data to Mozilla (Settings > Privacy) if that's
                            something you're uncomfortable with. It is turned on
                            by default.)

                    <h4>Step 2: Startpage</h4>
                    <p>
                        Startpage is a privacy-focused search engine that has
                        honestly served me well in 99% of my use cases. It
                        serves Google search results without* tracking your
                        activity and selling it to third parties.

                            that Startpage had apparently started to fingerprint
                            users. The entire thread is somewhat of a
                            nerve-wracking read; but after some more
                            investigating, and Startpage themselves intervening
                            to do damage control, all but a few of the users
                            seemed convinced that the fingerprinting was for the
                            limited use case of bot detection/abuse prevention.
                            For that reason, and this thread being the last
                            major concern about the service to my knowledge, I
                            keep this recommendation in this post.</em

                    <p>Another consideration, from PrivacyGuides themselves:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>
                            Startpage's majority shareholder is System1 who is
                            an adtech company. We don't believe that to be an
                            issue as they have a distinctly separate privacy
                            policy. The Privacy Guides team reached out to
                            Startpage back in 2020 to clear up any concerns with
                            System1's sizeable investment into the service, and
                            we were satisfied with the answers we received.

                        Search engines are their own rabbit holes; if you want
                        to go further, you can check out the metasearch engine
                        <a href="https://docs.searxng.org/">SearXNG</a>, and/or
                        rotate between multiple search engines so that your
                        search history can't be tracked to a single place. But
                        realistically, for most people that's a lot to ask for.
