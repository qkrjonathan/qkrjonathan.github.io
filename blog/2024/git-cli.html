                    <p>
                        I hate Git documentation. I hate it. I just want to
                        write something on this website and then push the
                        updated files to the repo, and it never works the first
                        time, and the documentation never just tells me what I
                        want to know, and then I just bang my head on the wall
                        until something works, and then I forget what makes it
                        work, and then it's the same process all over again the
                        next month.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This blog exists primarily to end that cycle, and,
                        secondarily, for anyone else who might find it useful to
                        have all this information in one place.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's been an especially painful process since I've been
                        used to GitHub Desktop for so long (I don't want to hear
                        it) before I switched over to Linux and was subsequently
                        forced to transition from GUI to CLI. But fear no more.
                        This will be a definitive one-stop shop for all my CLI
                        needs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For context: My only practical use of GitHub has been to
                        update my personal website (the one you are on now), and
                        my writing blog, the25post[.]com &mdash; both of which
                        are static GitHub Pages websites. This means pushing
                        updated HTML, CSS, and JS files from my Zed clone to the
                        actual repo.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        First, my specs: I'm running Zed (<a
                            href="https://zed.dev/"
                            >zed.dev</a
                        >), an open-source code editor for macOS and Linux that
                        has Claude 3.5 Sonnet embedded in it &mdash; with
                        support for other LLMs as well. (Imagine VSCode but a
                        little cooler, and a little more annoying with
                        auto-formatting on filesave.) My PC runs on Linux Mint
                        22. (More on that to come.)
                    </p>

                    <h4>A quick tangent on previewing website output</h4>

                    <p>
                        I moved to Zed from VSCode, where there was an existing
                        Live Preview plugin that was quite convenient for
                        frontend dev. Zed doesn't have that, which threw me for
                        a loop. But fortunately, there's a solution:
                        <a href="https://browsersync.io">browsersync</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The installation is pretty simple, and it's listed here
                        as well:
                        <a href="https://browsersync.io/#install"
                            >https://browsersync.io/#install</a
                        >. With Node.js, you can simply open a terminal and type
                        <code class="language-css"
                            >npm install -g browser-sync</code
                        >, then you're done. In your Zed bash, you can then type
                        <code class="language-css"
                            >browser-sync start --server --files css/*.css</code
                        >
                        and a new tab should open on your default browser.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I always forget that last command, though, and I don't
                        particularly care to memorize it; I have it under a .txt
                        file that I then
                        <code class="language-css">cat</code> in and copy paste
                        whenever I need it.
                    </p>

                    <h4>The process</h4>

                    <p>
                        First things first, recognize that the modern way to
                        connect to Git and update your repo is to connect via
                        SSH.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The detailed documentation for all of that is
                        <a
                            href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh"
                            >here</a
                        >, but it can be a little (and by a little I mean very)
                        overwhelming. The important part for me, at least, was
                        generating an SSH key and getting it to my account.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Follow the steps
                        <a
                            href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent"
                            >here</a
                        >
                        to generate a new SSH key and add it to the
                        <code class="language-css">ssh-agent</code>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then add the SSH keys to your GitHub account (<a
                            href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account"
                            >instructions here</a
                        >).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now test your SSH connection by opening bash and typing
                        <code class="language-css">ssh -T git@github.com</code>.
                        You may see a message like this:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code class="language-css">> The authenticity of host 'github.com (IP ADDRESS)' can't be established. ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:+DiY3wvvV6TuJJhbpZisF/zLDA0zPMSvHdkr4UvCOqU. Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        IF this fingerprint matches
                        <a
                            href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/githubs-ssh-key-fingerprints"
                            >GitHub's SSH key fingerprint</a
                        >, then type yes, and you should get the following:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code class="language-css"> Hi USERNAME! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        This is good. You can now proceed with actually sending
                        stuff to the GitHub repo.
