                        So here's the situation. I have this 17-inch LG Gram
                        that's been chugging along with me as I get through
                        college. Windows 10 came in the box (this was before
                        Windows 11 became available). By the summer of 2024, I
                        had just finished my post-junior-year internship in
                        cybersecurity, and I was feeling cocky. I decided the
                        likes of Windows (derogatory) were beneath me, and I
                        wanted to switch to Linux. I chose Mint as my distro,
                        since it seemed the friendliest to a beginner like
                        myself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This ended up working just fine. I got a 16GB SanDisk
                        USB, made it into a bootable stick with Mint 22 on it,
                        then booted up my laptop with it. The install went
                        ahead, and I was now on Linux.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fast forward a few months, to now, in October. My
                        experiences with Linux have been great, and fascinating.
                        Up to this point I'd only really played with Kali in VMs
                        (because I was forced to for a few classes) and my
                        memory of the terminal commands had come and gone like a
                        flash of light.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But there were annoyances. Like it or not, Windows is
                        still one of the dominant OSs, and I reached points
                        where I needed Windows to run this or that app. My
                        photography hobby, for instance, had me yearning for
                        Lightroom Classic &mdash; an annoying, but powerful and
                        unmatched, tool that is not and probably never will be
                        available on Linux.

                        I tried to ignore it for as long as I could, but
                        inevitably I reached the dreaded conclusion: I missed
                        Windows. I wanted it back.

                        What has ensued in the past 72 hours has been nothing
                        short of a disaster as I've tried to work out how to get
                        Windows on my system again. But in the process I've
                        actually learned quite a bit about how operating systems
                        work and present themselves to end users. But we'll get
                        to that later.

                        When I had first installed Mint, it had quite kindly
                        given me the option to dual-boot it alongside my
                        then-existing Windows OS. But I was blindsided, and I
                        declined this option. That was the first mistake.
                    </p>

                    <h4 id="calm">The calm before the storm</h4>
                    <p>
                        In the time since I initially installed Mint, from time
                        to time I had halfheartedly searched for ways to
                        retroactively dual boot Windows on top of my now-default
                        Linux. There were some tutorials, and I scrolled through
                        them, but I'd never been particularly motivated to
                        follow through with them. I was busy (classic excuse),
                        and besides, I was doing quite fine without them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But now, though, the worst of midterm season was over,
                        so I decided to finally sit down and get this done.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Initially, my approach was to get a proper bootable USB
                        with a Windows disk image burned onto it, so that
                        whenever I plugged in that USB it would boot as Windows
                        &mdash; and presumably without that USB it would just
                        boot Linux Mint as usual. (In retrospect, this was
                        extremely naive, to put it kindly.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I grabbed the same 16GB USB I'd used to install Mint,
                        and I set out to have Windows burned onto it. Somewhere
                        down the rabbit hole, I'd learned about
                        <a href="https://ventoy.net/en/index.html">Ventoy</a>, a
                        tool that allows you to use a single USB to load up any
                        number of OSs. So I formatted the USB, installed Ventoy,
                        and copied over a Windows 10 ISO per the instructions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This actually worked, at least in the beginning. When I
                        booted the system with the USB in it, I could see the
                        Ventoy launch screen, where I was prompted to select my
                        Windows ISO. That led to the proper Windows installer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is where the issues began. My hard drive had two
                        partitions: an EFI partition, which has all the
                        instructions for the system to actually boot the
                        operating system (Linux in this case); and a filesystem.
                        Neither partition would accept a Windows install. I
                        tried everything*, but nothing worked. So I gave up,
                        took out the USB, and restarted to boot Mint again.
                    </p>

                    <h4 id="first">The first panic</h4>
                    <p>
                        Staring back at me instead was a hapless "Boot Menu,"
                        which gave me two options: "ubuntu" or
                        meaningless-string-of-numbers (the name of my hard
                        drive, to be exact, which had nothing on it anyway). I
                        selected "ubuntu." It just returned to the Boot Menu. I
                        selected "ubuntu" again. It just returned to the Boot
                        Menu again. I selected "ubuntu" a third time. Same
                        thing.

                    <p>
                        I had hit a wall. My two options were either fail to
                        boot Windows or fail to boot Linux Mint. My laptop was
                        functionally a dud.

                    <p>
                        After some minutes of internal screaming, I decided not
                        all hope was lost &mdash; I could start from scratch and
                        boot up a fresh copy of Linux Mint. It was already
                        getting late at night by this point, so I went to bed.
                    </p>

                    <h4 id="second">The second panic</h4>
                    <p>
                        The next morning, I felt refreshed and confident enough
                        to try again. I borrowed my roommate's computer to get a
                        new copy of Linux Mint (which he somehow trusted me to
                        do, thankfully) and tried booting my own laptop up with
                        that new copy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For approximately five seconds, I felt a glimmer of
                        hope. A launch screen gave me to option to launch Mint
                        22, normally or in compatability mode. I selected normal
                        mode.

                        After some frantic log output, this is what greeted me:

                        So the kernel was panicking &mdash; and so was I, again.
                        I tried again in compatability mode, and got the same
                        thing. I turned UEFI Secure Boot off, and got the same
                        thing.

                        This is when I came to a realization: When I was trying
                        to install Windows the first time, in pressing any
                        button that was available to me trying to make things
                        work I had formatted the EFI partition of my hard drive.
                        Which meant, the laptop had lost all instructions on
                        connecting to the kernel and was therefore stumped.

                        I'll skip over the several hours of frantic searching of
                        forums that followed. After that, though, I had managed
                        to find a solution that would goad the laptop to find
                        the kernel and set it as the root

                        This handholding worked well enough for the next few
                        days, where I was too busy with other things to care
                        about the workaround; and besides, I didn't need to shut
                        my device down and boot from scratch often enough where
                        it really mattered.

                    <p>
                        But it did feel scuffed, so after those few days I
                        sought a proper fix.

                    <p>
                        I searched again, this time with actual effort, for a
                        way to properly dual-boot Windows on my existing Linux
                        machine. This time, I struck gold: a blog by Abhishek
                        Prakash (posted 9 October!) gave step by step
                        instructions that actually worked.

                        >
                        is quite long; but the key point is this: I needed to
                        make both a functioning Linux Mint USB and a Windows USB
                        (the latter via Ventoy),
                        <strong
                            >and then use the Linux Mint USB to boot a temporary
                            new run of Linux, where I could partition my hard
                            drive to make space for Windows.</strong
                        >
                        If I were to try that in my current in-use Mint OS, the
                        hard drive would be mounted (since the Mint OS is using
                        it to run) and would not be available to partition.

                        Then I went ahead with the Windows install, after which
                        I updated GRUB to detect the new Windows (<code
                            class="language-css"
                            >sudo update-grub</code
                        >. Then I rebooted, and &mdash; finally &mdash; the GRUB
                        bootloader appeared, with two options: boot Linux, or
                        boot Windows.

                        The nightmare was over, and I had the added benefit of
                        learning valuable lessons about the intricacies of
                        dual-booting, and the importance of understanding how
                        operating systems interact with hardware. I also was
                        able to internalize what I had known all along: that for
                        every issue there's a solution for it on the internet
                        &mdash; whether it's a forum post from thirteen years
                        ago or a blog post from last week. At this stage, I'd
                        love to learn more about the workings of UEFI and BIOS;
                        if I do move on from Mint to other Linux distros, this
                        process would be something to revisit all over again. If
                        or when that does happen, I'll make another post about
                        that process.
