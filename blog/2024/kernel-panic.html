                        So here's the situation. I have this 17-inch LG Gram
                        that's been chugging along with me as I get through
                        college. Windows 10 came in the box (this was before
                        Windows 11 became available). By the summer of 2024, I
                        had just finished my post-junior-year internship in
                        cybersecurity, and I was feeling cocky. I decided the
                        likes of Windows (derogatory) were beneath me, and I
                        wanted to switch to Linux. I chose Mint as my distro,
                        since it seemed the friendliest to a beginner like
                        myself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This ended up working just fine. I got a 16GB SanDisk
                        USB, made it into a bootable stick with Mint 22 on it,
                        then booted up my laptop with it. The install went
                        ahead, and I was now on Linux.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fast forward a few months, to now, in October. My
                        experiences with Linux have been great, and fascinating.
                        Up to this point I'd only really played with Kali in VMs
                        (because I was forced to for a few classes) and my
                        memory of the terminal commands had come and gone like a
                        flash of light.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But there were annoyances. Like it or not, Windows is
                        still one of the dominant OSs, and I reached points
                        where I needed Windows to run this or that app. My
                        photography hobby, for instance, had me yearning for
                        Lightroom Classic &mdash; an annoying, but powerful and
                        unmatched, tool that is not and probably never will be
                        available on Linux.
