                        So here's the situation. I have this 17-inch LG Gram
                        that's been chugging along with me as I get through
                        college. Windows 10 came in the box (this was before
                        Windows 11 became available). By the summer of 2024, I
                        had just finished my post-junior-year internship in
                        cybersecurity, and I was feeling cocky. I decided the
                        likes of Windows (derogatory) were beneath me, and I
                        wanted to switch to Linux. I chose Mint as my distro,
                        since it seemed the friendliest to a beginner like
                        myself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This ended up working just fine. I got a 16GB SanDisk
                        USB, made it into a bootable stick with Mint 22 on it,
                        then booted up my laptop with it. The install went
                        ahead, and I was now on Linux.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fast forward a few months, to now, in October. My
                        experiences with Linux have been great, and fascinating.
                        Up to this point I'd only really played with Kali in VMs
                        (because I was forced to for a few classes) and my
                        memory of the terminal commands had come and gone like a
                        flash of light.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But there were annoyances. Like it or not, Windows is
                        still one of the dominant OSs, and I reached points
                        where I needed Windows to run this or that app. My
                        photography hobby, for instance, had me yearning for
                        Lightroom Classic &mdash; an annoying, but powerful and
                        unmatched, tool that is not and probably never will be
                        available on Linux.

                        I tried to ignore it for as long as I could, but
                        inevitably I reached the dreaded conclusion: I missed
                        Windows. I wanted it back.

                        What has ensued in the past 72 hours has been nothing
                        short of a disaster as I've tried to work out how to get
                        Windows on my system again. But in the process I've
                        actually learned quite a bit about how operating systems
                        work and present themselves to end users. But we'll get
                        to that later.

                        When I had first installed Mint, it had quite kindly
                        given me the option to dual-boot it alongside my
                        then-existing Windows OS. But I was blindsided, and I
                        declined this option. That was the first mistake.
                    </p>

                    <h4>The calm before the storm</h4>
                    <p>
                        In the time since I initially installed Mint, from time
                        to time I had halfheartedly searched for ways to
                        retroactively dual boot Windows on top of my now-default
                        Linux. There were some tutorials, and I scrolled through
                        them, but I'd never been particularly motivated to
                        follow through with them. I was busy (classic excuse),
                        and besides, I was doing quite fine without them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But now, though, the worst of midterm season was over,
                        so I decided to finally sit down and get this done.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Initially, my approach was to get a proper bootable USB
                        with a Windows disk image burned onto it, so that
                        whenever I plugged in that USB it would boot as Windows
                        &mdash; and presumably without that USB it would just
                        boot Linux Mint as usual. (In retrospect, this was
                        extremely naive, to put it kindly.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I grabbed the same 16GB USB I'd used to install Mint,
                        and I set out to have Windows burned onto it. Somewhere
                        down the rabbit hole, I'd learned about
                        <a href="https://ventoy.net/en/index.html">Ventoy</a>, a
                        tool that allows you to use a single USB to load up any
                        number of OSs. So I formatted the USB, installed Ventoy,
                        and copied over a Windows 10 ISO per the instructions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This actually worked, at least in the beginning. When I
                        booted the system with the USB in it, I could see the
                        Ventoy launch screen, where I was prompted to select my
                        Windows ISO. That led to the proper Windows installer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is where the issues began. My hard drive had two
                        partitions: an EFI partition, which has all the
                        instructions for the system to actually boot the
                        operating system (Linux in this case); and a filesystem.
                        Neither partition would accept a Windows install. I
                        tried everything*, but nothing worked. So I gave up,
                        took out the USB, and restarted to boot Mint again.
                    </p>

                    <h4>The first panic</h4>
                    <p>
                        Staring back at me instead was a hapless "Boot Menu,"
                        which gave me two options: "ubuntu" or
                        meaningless-string-of-numbers. I selected "ubuntu." It
                        just returned to the Boot Menu. I selected "ubuntu"
                        again. It just returned to the Boot Menu again. I
                        selected "ubuntu" a third time. Same thing.
                    </p>

                        given.

                    <p>
                        I had hit a wall. My two options were either fail to
                        boot Windows or fail to boot Linux Mint. My laptop was
                        functionally a dud.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After some minutes of internal screaming, I decided not
                        all hope was lost &mdash; I could start from scratch and
                        boot up a fresh copy of Linux Mint. It was already
                        getting late at night by this point, so I went to bed.
