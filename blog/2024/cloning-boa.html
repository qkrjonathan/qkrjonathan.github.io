                    <h2>Cloning the Bank of America homepage</h2>
                    <h6>10 August 2024</h6>
                    <p>
                        The Bank of America homepage, like any index webpage for
                        a bank or other financial service, is undoubtedly one of
                        the more tempting webpages that threat actors will try
                        to clone. With enough effort, and a gullible enough
                        target, a webpage clone could suffice in extracting user
                        credentials.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bank of America probably knows this, and their
                        developers have taken subtle but effective measures to
                        ensure their homepage,
                        <a
                            href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/"
                            style="text-decoration: underline !important"
                            >https://www.bankofamerica.com/</a
                        >, can't be so easily cloned.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this post, I try to clone the page for myself, and
                        reveal here what I found along the way.
                    </p>
                    <h4>The easy way out</h4>
                    <p>
                        The first thing to try is to be lazy and copy the entire
                        HTML as it appears in "Inspect element."
                    </p>
                    <img src="../../uploads/boa-ss-1.png" style="width: 100%" />
                    <p>That yields a very similar result to the original:</p>
                    <img src="../../uploads/boa-ss-2.png" style="width: 100%" />
                    <p>
                        But you'll immediately notice several things wrong with
                        this. First of all, the font is wrong. Bank of America
                        seems to use a proprietary "cnx" family of fonts, and
                        while I was able to find the source URLs for those
                        fonts, they refused to load when I tried to replicate
                        the
                        <code class="language-css">@font-face</code>
                        configuration.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code class="language-css">/* Snippet of https://www2.bac-assets.com/spa/widgets/global-search-public-widget/2.0.0/spa-assets/css/styles-5a3ed7c942389fca8dca.m.css */

                    <p>
                        Meanwhile, my clone defaults to Roboto &mdash; and I got
                        the impression that, when actually building this page
                        from scratch, that was the best I was going to get.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An interesting thing to note is that when a user
                        attempts to log in on this clone, the user is still
                        redirected to the actual Bank of America screen, as one
                        would expect from a normal BofA login.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So really, what a potential threat actor would need to
                        do is recreate that red box, and insert in there some
                        <code class="language-css">&lt;form&gt;</code> that
                        sends the inputs to the desired destination.
                    </p>

                    <img
                        src="../../uploads/boa-ss-3.png"
                        style="width: 200px"
                    />

                    <p>
                        In terms of pure frontend, this box is not so difficult
                        to replicate. It's two
                        <code class="language-css">&lt;input&gt;</code>s, a
                        checkbox, a "Log In" button, and some spare links at the
                        bottom.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But the real issue is going into that copy-pasted HTML
                        code and (a) trying to find out where the hell the code
                        for that red box even is, out of 1300-plus lines, and
                        (b) then making that new customized
                        <code class="language-css">&lt;form&gt;</code> of yours
                        actually work. The first part was the easy part, and
                        even that took a while, with all the nooks and crannies
                        and nested divs. As for the second part, I made a
                        half-hearted attempt to edit the "Log In" button so that
                        it would direct the user to the music video for "Never
                        Gonna Give You Up" by Rick Astley, but I couldn't get it
                        to work. There was some operation happening that ensured
                        the form was always sent to the real Bank of America
                        login page. It remains elusive, at least for me, as to
                        whether bypassing that is possible.
                    </p>

                    <br />
                    <h4>Conclusions</h4>
                    <p>
                        In attempting to clone the Bank of America homepage, I
                        learned the hard way about the complexity and
                        sophistication of modern web security. While copying a
                        webpage's basic structure can be relatively
                        straightforward, achieving an exact replica is
                        significantly more challenging due to custom fonts,
                        intricate CSS, and advanced JavaScript functionalities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As someone who, by all measures, is still a beginner
                        when it comes to web development, it is humbling and
                        inspiring to know there is such incredible depth to
                        secure frontend building that I have yet to even be
                        aware of. Further research could delve into advanced web
                        security techniques, proprietary technologies, form
                        redirection mechanisms, and the ethical implications of
                        web cloning, contributing to a deeper understanding of
                        both the challenges and best practices in creating and
                        safeguarding web content.
