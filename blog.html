                        This setup uses Active Directory and Sysmon installed across Windows 10 and Windows Server 2022 virtual machines (the former also serving as a target machine), the logs of which feed into Splunk hosted on an Ubuntu Server machine. There is also a Kali Linux machine serving as an attacker.

                        This is the opening of a new world for me. I’ve been
                        looking into home labs for a little bit, now being
                        fresh out of college, newly minted bachelor’s degree
                        and all. With my summer internship in cybersecurity
                        fading further and further into the past, I hadn’t
                        had the chance since then ...

                        On 20 November, the U.S. Department of Justice
                        submitted a court filing demanding that Google sell
                        its browser Chrome and be banned from pursuing
                        contracts that make its search engine the default on
                        smartphones and laptops. This comes amid an ongoing
                        effort to break up Google's domineering monopoly on
                        the online search market &hellip;

                        So here's the situation. I have this 17-inch LG Gram
                        that's been chugging along with me as I get through
                        college. Windows 10 came in the box (this was before
                        Windows 11 became available). By the summer of 2024,
                        I had just finished my post-junior-year internship
                        in cybersecurity, and I was feeling cocky. I decided
                        the likes of Windows (derogatory) were beneath me,
                        and I wanted to switch to Linux &hellip;

                        I hate Git documentation. I hate it. I just want to

                        updated files to the repo, and it never works the
                        first time, and the documentation never works, and
                        then I just bang my head on the wall until something

                        and a gullible enough target, a webpage clone could
                        suffice in extracting user credentials &hellip;
